### script name: Auto.py 
#### Description.
Is a browser automation program
NOTE:Github does not permit you crawling them so they only allow some few tests then they will ask for authentication. So do not use this script many times
```
The method demonstrated here can work for any site and you can automate your browser activities
The script is written and tested in python3 and we use selenium for the automation and browser interaction.
```
**In our case we try to automate the github
activity**
* The script will login to github and create a new repository
* When using this script remember to change the *username* and *password* to match those of your account,
Edit the script then save it:
To run it: 
```
$python3 auto.py -c repo-name
```
**This will login to your github page and create a new repository called repo-name**
